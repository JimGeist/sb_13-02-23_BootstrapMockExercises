## Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome mock web sites.

Assignment involved the creation of two mock web pages that used Twitter Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Lorem Flickr for placeholder images. A css custom file was written so crimson could get added as class for the remove (trash can icon) on Step 2.

Please go to [Bootstrap Mocks](https://jimgeist.github.io/sb_13-02-23_BootstrapMockExercises/) for the links to both exercises. (Yay, no jasmine!!)
